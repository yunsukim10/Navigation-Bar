        <h1><a name="one">Earth Institute Director Sir Alex Halliday pushes to establish Columbia as a leader in climate change research</a></h1>
        <div class = "article">In his first year at Columbia, Sir Alex Halliday, director of the Earth Institute, has focused his efforts on leveraging the multidisciplinary nature of the institute to better combat climate change, increase student involvement in institute initiatives, and push for greater internal progress regarding sustainability on Columbia’s campus.

        In December 2017, University President Lee Bollinger announced Halliday as the new director, filling a vital role in the Earth Institute, which had been without permanent leadership for more than a year and a half. Halliday, already established as a famed geochemist at Oxford, officially began his role in April 2018. He was knighted this year for his contributions to scientific research.

        The Earth Institute has been a leader in global science since its inception more than two decades ago in 1995. It brings together faculty from the Law School, School of International and Public Affairs, and Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation to work alongside traditional scientists—an interdisciplinary aspect Halliday said he admired when he first joined. The International Research Institute for Climate and Society, an organization within the Earth Institute, has also been involved in the University’s inaugural project under Columbia World Projects, an initiative Bollinger introduced in April 2017 with the goal of having researchers solve real-world problems.

        <h1><a name="two">Columbia says it abides by federal law for reporting hate crimes. Students and experts argue that compliance is not always enough.</a></h1>
        <div class = "article">Nineteen alleged hate crimes and bias-related incidents have been reported to Public Safety on Columbia’s Morningside campus since 2015, according to a Spectator review of crime logs. A majority of those incidents did not trigger immediate University-wide communications sent directly to students.

        Under a federal law known as the Clery Act, the University is not mandated to notify students of all bias-related incidents documented in its crime logs; Public Safety is only required to inform the student body of Clery reportable crimes, including hate crimes, that pose an “ongoing security threat” to students. Legally, this excludes all incidents categorized as “harassment” under the crime logs, but may include criminal offenses such as burglary, assault, and vandalism, especially when the perpetrator is still unidentified and at large.

        The Clery Act also does not specify what factors might constitute an ongoing threat for a hate crime. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education provides a series of hypothetical scenarios meant to guide universities in determining whether something should be classified as an ongoing threat. Ultimately, the decision is up to the discretion of the individual school, according to legal Clery Act experts.

        On the Morningside campus, one bias-related assault and three bias-related harassments were reported to Public Safety in the past year alone. The three incidents of harassment occurred over the span of just two months, raising concerns from students and the Columbia community about the University’s role in reporting them to the community.</div>

        <h1><a name="three">Despite recent renovations, students fail to take advantage of Lerner Central Lounge as recreational space</a></h1>
        <div class = "article">Lerner Central Lounge, the recently refurbished study-free space dedicated to student recreation, has become yet another study space one semester after its opening.

        In response to frequent calls from students for more community-based spaces on campus, the Student Affairs Committee, a subcommittee of the University Senate, generated a proposal in 2017 advocating for the creation of a space for students to relax in Lerner Hall.

        At the start of last semester, a lounge on the second floor of Lerner that previously served as a reservable meeting space for student groups underwent significant renovations. The lounge now features an air hockey table, two foosball tables, Jenga, chess, and other board games. A sign outside the door states: “This is a study-free zone. Please enjoy yourself.”

        However, only a semester after the lounge’s creation, a majority of students have chosen to utilize the space primarily as another study area, leaving a number of its recreational facilities often unused. At a town hall on mental health in October, a number of students complained that many of their peers often ignored the signs promoting recreation.

        Interviews with students working in the lounge demonstrate a preference to use the space to study, as well as a general apathy toward spending time recreationally in Lerner. Since most students are reading or working silently, the lounge is often too quiet for other students to use the equipment provided.

        According to Scott Wright, vice president for campus services, the popularity of the space is itself a success of the redesign.

        “There’s so many needs for so many kinds of activities in Lerner that the thing that I would consider to be a failure would be if no one was using the new spaces, but they are,” Wright said. “How students are using them, to me, is up to students.”

        <h1><a name="four">Amid public allegations of plagiarism, reputation and academic integrity of Korean studies program face scrutiny
        </a></h1>
        <div class = "article">History professor Charles Armstrong, who specializes in modern Korean, East Asian, and international history, has faced accusations of source fabrication, plagiarism, and falsifying sources in his 2013 book, “Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992,” since 2016.

        In November 2016, professor Balazs Szalontai of Korea University filed a formal complaint to Columbia alleging that Armstrong’s book included 76 cases of academic misconduct. In 2017, Szalontai discovered a number of additional problems in the work, raising the total number of cases to 98. In 2017, professor of East Asian Studies at Oberlin College Sheila Miyoshi Jager publicly resigned from the advisory board of the Wilson Center’s Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History and Public Policy in protest of Armstrong’s actions.

        While Szalontai filed the case to Provost John Coatsworth, the University’s Office of Research Compliance and Training handles investigations into allegations of plagiarism or fabrication. According to the University’s Institutional Policy on Misconduct in Research, investigation should be completed within 120 days of its initiation, and an adjudication should be completed within 60 days of its initiation.

        Two years later, the University has declined to comment publicly on the case, neither defending nor confirming the persistent allegations. Because Columbia’s investigations into academic integrity are confidential, if an investigation has been underway since 2016, its details would remain undisclosed until a decision had been made.

        A number of other professors, however, both within Columbia’s department and outside the University, have pointed to the allegations as undermining Armstrong’s academic integrity. The case has also highlighted the broader issue of addressing sensitive issues such as research integrity due to the close-knit, protective nature of academic communities.

        Scholars have increasingly questioned whether Columbia should continue to remain silent on the allegations, which have become public on social media, sparking concerns over the history department’s reputation. This debate has brought to light concerns from faculty over how the accusations could impact the department’s reputation and its students.

        The chair of the history department declined to comment on the allegations of plagiarism or their impact on the department.

        In response to the public criticism, Armstrong made 80 corrections to the original book, and it was reprinted in 2017. Szalontai, however, claimed in March 2018 that the reprint still contained as many as 29 invalid citations, of which 26 involved plagiarism. Szalontai published another article on academia.edu outlining the problems in the reprinted edition, especially taking issue with the fact that the new version was defined as a reprint rather than a corrected edition.

        In a now-deleted blog post, Armstrong wrote that he believes his corrections have sufficiently addressed concerns of the academic community.</div>
